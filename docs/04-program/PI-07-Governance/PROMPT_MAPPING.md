| Implement | \`.ai/commands/implement-story.md\` | Before writing the first line |
| Review | \`.ai/commands/review-story.md\` | Before raising a PR |
| Generate Tests | \`.ai/commands/generate-tests.md\` | Alongside or after implementation |
| Security Review | \`.ai/commands/security-review.md\` | On every story touching auth, secrets, or data |

Additional commands used when applicable:

| Activity | Command | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Performance Review | \`.ai/commands/performance-review.md\` | Stories with latency or throughput targets |
| Documentation | \`.ai/commands/update-documentation.md\` | Stories producing a new API or public interface |
| Release | \`.ai/commands/release-story.md\` | End-of-PI release stories only |
